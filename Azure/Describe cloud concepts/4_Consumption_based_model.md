# 💰 CapEx vs OpEx & Cloud Pricing Models -- Quick Notes

## 🏗 CapEx (Capital Expenditure)

-   **Definition:** One-time, up-front purchase of physical/tangible
    resources.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Building a datacenter
    -   Buying servers, networking hardware
    -   Purchasing company vehicles
    -   Constructing physical infrastructure
-   **Characteristics:**
    -   High initial cost
    -   Depreciates over time
    -   Requires capacity planning (may over/underestimate)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 OpEx (Operational Expenditure)

-   **Definition:** Ongoing expense for products/services consumed over
    time.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Cloud services subscription
    -   Leasing vehicles
    -   Renting facilities
-   **Characteristics:**
    -   No upfront cost
    -   Pay-as-you-go
    -   Flexible and scalable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ☁️ Cloud Computing = OpEx

-   **Consumption-based model:** Pay only for what you use.
-   **No costs for:** Physical infrastructure, power, cooling, security,
    maintenance.

### ✅ Benefits

-   No upfront cost or capacity over-provisioning.
-   Add/remove resources on-demand.
-   Pay only for actual usage.
-   Avoid waste from unused infrastructure.

## 📊 Cloud vs Traditional Datacenter

| **Aspect**       | **Traditional Datacenter (CapEx)** | **Cloud (OpEx)**               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Cost**         | Large upfront investment          | Pay-as-you-go                 |
| **Scalability**  | Slow (purchase & install hardware)| Fast & elastic – add/remove anytime |
| **Planning**     | Must predict future demand        | Adjust dynamically as needed  |
| **Waste Risk**   | Overestimate → money wasted       | Only pay for what you use     |

## 💡 Cloud Pricing Model

-   **Pay-as-you-go:** Billed for compute/storage/resources consumed.
-   **Advantages:**
    -   Predict & control costs
    -   Scale infrastructure with business needs
    -   Treat compute as a **rented utility**
-   **Lifecycle:**
    -   Provision → Use → Deprovision → Stop paying
