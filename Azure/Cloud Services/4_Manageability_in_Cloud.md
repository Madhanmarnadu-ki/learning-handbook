# 🛠 Manageability in the Cloud – Quick Notes

Cloud computing offers strong **manageability options**, divided into two areas:

---

## ☁️ Management of the Cloud
Focuses on **managing cloud resources themselves**:
- **Autoscaling:** Automatically scale resources up/down based on demand.
- **Template-based deployment:** Deploy resources from preconfigured templates (e.g., ARM templates, Bicep) — no manual setup needed.
- **Health monitoring:** Continuously monitor resource health and replace failing resources automatically.
- **Real-time alerts:** Get notified based on metrics (e.g., CPU usage, response time) for proactive issue resolution.

## 🌐 Management in the Cloud
Focuses on **how you manage the environment and resources**:
- **Web Portal:** Azure Portal – browser-based UI for resource management.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Azure CLI – scriptable commands for automation.
- **APIs:** REST APIs – programmatically manage Azure resources.
- **PowerShell:** Manage and automate Azure resources using PowerShell cmdlets.
